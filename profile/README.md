MCC INFO1325-WI Game Jam team.


### Team Pitch
The game we are creating will be called Jelly Smash

The goal of the game is to smash jars of jam. The game will have varying levels of difficuly by increasing the speed of the falling jars, requiring the player to be very accurate. Don't hit anything that is not jam.
Don't miss the jars. Good luck!
